# 👋 Hey there!

I'm Miguel — a freelancer, student, and currently an intern Flutter developer.  
I love building things that **make people's lives easier** (and hopefully a bit more fun).

## 💻 What I do

- ⚡️ I explore all kinds of tech: Flutter, Dart, React, React Native, Next.js, Expo, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Haskell, Docusaurus, Unreal Engine, Godot, Unity... basically everything I can get my hands on.
- 🚀 Currently working on an open source project to make website creation easier, with dynamic page generation. (Migrating it from Next.js to Astro — fun times!)

## 🎸 Besides coding...

- I write stories (sometimes too many at once 👀)
- I play guitar & go to concerts (loud music = happy brain)
- I climb things when I need a break from screens
